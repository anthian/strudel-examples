<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[https://strudel.cc/](strudel.cc) is a web-based live coding environment for creating and performing music using code, specifically JavaScript, within a web browser. It is inspired by the TidalCycles project and allows users to generate patterns, melodies, and entire compositions by writing code. It's designed to be accessible to both beginners and experienced users, requiring no installation and offering a JavaScript-like syntax.

This private repository was created to collect some examples found on the web and add my variations to learn how to code songs on this platform.
